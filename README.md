# Courses

This repository contains files for some online courses I have taken. The idea is to create a beautiful website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to serve the notebooks for these courses. Available courses are:

- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans)
- [TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
- [Four Short Courses on DeepLearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)
  - How Diffusion Models Work
  - LangChain for LLM Application Development
  - ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers
  - Building Systems with the ChatGPT API
More courses will be added in the future.
